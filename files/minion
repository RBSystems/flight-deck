##### Primary configuration settings #####
##########################################
# This configuration file is used to manage the behavior of the Salt Minion.
# With the exception of the location of the Salt Master Server, values that are
# commented out but have an empty line after the comment are defaults that need
# not be set in the config. If there is no blank line after the comment, the
# value is presented as an example and is not the default.

# Set the location of the salt master server. If the master server cannot be
# resolved, then the minion will fail to start.
master: $SALT_MASTER_HOST
master_finger: $SALT_MASTER_FINGER # Set http proxy information for the minion when doing requests

# TODO set SYSTEM_ID in /etc/salt/minion_id, and remove this line
# Explicitly declare the id for this minion to use, if left commented the id
# will be the hostname as returned by the python call: socket.getfqdn()
# Since salt uses detached ids it is possible to run multiple minions on the
# same machine but with different ids, this can be useful for salt compute
# clusters.
id: $SYSTEM_ID

#
# Run states when the minion daemon starts. To enable, set startup_states to:
# 'highstate' -- Execute state.highstate
# 'sls' -- Read in the sls_list option and execute the named sls files
# 'top' -- Read top_file option and execute based on that file on the Master
startup_states: 'highstate'
